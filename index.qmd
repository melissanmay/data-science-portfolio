Hi! My name is Melissa May and I am currently a student at Colorado State University completing her final semester as an undergraduate. I am majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and minoring in Political Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of environmental data science, ecosystem analysis, and natural resource policy.

Since moving to Colorado in 2018, I've been captivated by the state's diverse ecosystems and am committed to using data-driven approaches to support conservation and sustainable management. I'm particularly interested in how geospatial analysis, data science, and policy implementation can work together to address complex environmental challenges.

This portfolio showcases my academic projects, research experience, and evolving skills in environmental data science and GIS.
